**Description:**

Chef has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to N. He wants to cut out K×K squares from this chart paper.

Find the maximum number of K×K squares he can cut from the entire chart paper.

Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any K×K cutout square.

**Input:**

- The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K — the side length of the entire chart paper and the side length of the cutout squares.

**Output:**

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of K×K squares Chef can cut from the entire chart paper.

**Constraints:**
 
 > - 1≤T≤1000
 
 > - 1≤K≤N≤1000
