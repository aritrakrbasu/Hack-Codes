- The set::count() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns the **number of times an element occurs** in the set. It can only return 1 or 0 as the set container contains unique elements only. 
```
if(!set.count(x)){
			vector.push_back(x);
			set.push(x);
}
```

Above function can be used to insert distinct elements in a vector.
