# Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

## Example 1
![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree3.png)

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 6

## Example 2
Input: root = []

Output: 0

## Example 3:

Input: root = [1]

Output: 1

## Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].

0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104

The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
