**Description:**

time limit per test : 1 second
memory limit per test : 256 megabytes
input : standard input
output : standard output

You are given an array a of n positive integers. Determine if, by rearranging the elements, you can make the array strictly increasing. In other words, determine if it is possible to rearrange the elements such that a1<a2<⋯<an holds.


### Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.

### Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if the array satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
