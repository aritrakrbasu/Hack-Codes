We want to get marks of each student of a class in Physics,Chemistry and Mathematics and the average marks
of the class. The number of students in the class are entered by the user. Create a class named Marks with datamembers
for roll number and marks. Create three other classes inheriting the Marks class, namely Physics, Chemistry and 
Mathematics, which are used to define marks in individual subject of each student. 
Roll number of each student will be generated automatically.
